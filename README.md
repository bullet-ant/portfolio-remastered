# Portfolio Remastered ðŸš€

Welcome to the codebase that proves I'll spend 30 hours optimizing something that could have been a PDF.

## What's This?

A stunningly over-engineered showcase of my work, built with React and styled-components because plain CSS just wasn't complicated enough.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on everything from a smart fridge to your mum's iPad
- **Smooth Animations:** So buttery smooth you might need to check your cholesterol 
- **Accessibility:** Inclusive to everyone except Internet Explorer users (sorry not sorry)

## Tech Stack

- React (because Svelte won't get me a job)
- Styled Components (CSS-in-JS: where everything is made up and the specificity doesn't matter)
- Framer Motion (for animations smoother than my pickup lines)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/bullet-ant/portfolio-remastered.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server 
npm run dev

# Now open http://localhost:5173/ 
```
